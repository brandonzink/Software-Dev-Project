**OLD PARTS TO README**  
    
Desription:  
A website used to share links, ideas, connect people, and facilitate growth driven conversation in an online enviroment. If you're familiar with Reddit and Facebook, a mashed together version of the two in sorts.  
  
Vision Statement:  
"Facilitate conversation, share knowledge, and connect like minded people."

Motivation:  
Our motivation for this project is in part to learn how a website is created and its interaction with databases and content storage. We are also interested in taking a simple yet popular idea that was put forth by Reddit in having all content come from the user, while also connecting the users to one another is a more personal relationship, and finding ways to make it our own. 

Risks:  
Many of us are new to the website creation, although we are all at least familiar with HTML and SQL. 

Mitigation Strategy:  
Cam has built a website before and will be a valuable resource to us as we all work on our contributions. There are also countless online resources that we can and will use to familiarize ourselves with website creation. 
  
User Stories:  
001: As a submitter, I want an easy interface to use when submitting material so that it takes as little time as possible.  
002: As a commenter, I want a simple, easy to follow comment chain interface so that I can follow the conversation.  
003: As a lonely individual, I want a way to find people that share similar interests and get to know them individually.  
004: As a knowledge seeking individual, I want an easy way to view lots of things that people find interesting to learn.  
005: As a general user, I want an easy way to view specifically what I am looking for to make using the site streamlined.  
006: As a submitter, I want simple to understand guidlines for submitting so that I don't go out of bounds.
006: As a Facebook user I like that I get to know my friends through their profile, but theres not much discussion between me and my friends beyond short comments. As a reddit user, theres great discussion, but I don't get to know the people I'm talking to. I want a social media that encourages the type of meaningful discussion seen on Reddit combined with the relationships and personality found on Facebook.
  
Methodology:  
Agile, though some of this will take place via texting as we talk about what we have finished.
